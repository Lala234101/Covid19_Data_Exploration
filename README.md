## COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
# Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL queries to analyze infection rates, death percentages, vaccination progress, and more. The analysis focuses on understanding the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents.

# Key Features
* Comprehensive SQL queries for COVID-19 data analysis

* Calculations of infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination statistics

* Comparative analysis between countries and continents

* Time-series tracking of cases and deaths

* Population vs. vaccination metrics

# Data Sources
The project uses two main datasets:

1. CovidDeaths: Contains COVID-19 case and death statistics

2. CovidVaccinations: Contains vaccination data

Both datasets include location, date, and population information for comprehensive analysis.

# Main Analysis Areas
1. Global Metrics:

* Total cases and deaths worldwide

* Death percentage calculations

2. Continental Analysis:

* Death counts by continent

* Comparison of infection rates

3. Country-Level Insights:

* Highest infection rates relative to population

* Death counts per country

* Vaccination progress tracking

4. Temporal Analysis:

* Daily case and death trends

* Infection rates over time

# Technical Implementation
1. SQL queries for data extraction and transformation

2. Use of advanced SQL features:

* Window functions for rolling calculations

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

* Temporary tables

* Views for persistent data storage

## Repository Structure
* Covid19 SQL Data exploration.sql: Main SQL script with all exploration queries

* Queries used for Tableau Project.txt: Selected queries optimized for Tableau visualization

* Tableau Project SQL Queries.sql: Additional queries for Tableau dashboard creation

How to Use
1. Clone the repository

2. Execute the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL environment

3. Connect the queries to visualization tools like Tableau for dashboard creation

## Potential Visualizations
* World maps showing infection rates

* Time-series charts of cases and deaths

* Bar charts comparing countries/continents

* Vaccination progress dashboards

Note
This project was designed for educational purposes to demonstrate SQL data exploration techniques using real-world COVID-19 data. The queries can be adapted for different database systems as needed.
